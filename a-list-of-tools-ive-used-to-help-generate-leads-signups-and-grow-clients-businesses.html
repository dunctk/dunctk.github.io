At least how that's I've used it. It's actually more versatile than that, and can be used across all parts of a business.</p><p></p><p></p><p>The way I've used it is to create personalised and interactive tools to attract leads. For example, this <a rel="noreferrer noopener" href="https://uplevelgreen.com/solar-panel-calculator/" data-type="URL" data-id="https://uplevelgreen.com/solar-panel-calculator/" target="_blank">solar panel cost calculator</a>, which helps people in the UK decide if solar panels are worth it for them (only works for UK addresses right now).</p><p></p><p></p><p>I've found it to be incredibly valuable, and the main reasons I've stuck with it over other tools are:</p><p></p><p></p><ul><li>It's incredibly flexible, you can build whatever you want</li><li>It's built by an experienced marketer so the functionality all makes sense for digital marketing (compared to 'survey' tools)</li><li>The community is probably the best out of any SaaS product, and the founder Nik is fantastic at taking time to help people get results with the software - better coaching than $2,000 digital marketing courses</li></ul><p></p><p></p><p></p><p></p><h2>Cold email</h2><p></p><p></p><h3 id="lemlist">Sending cold emails: Lemlist</h3><p></p><p></p><p><a href="https://lemlist.com" data-type="URL" data-id="https://lemlist.com">Lemlist</a> is one of those tools I orginally got in an AppSumo lifetime deal, and I'm really glad I did. They've seriously worked on it and improved since the orginal AppSumo deal. Personally I don't send very many cold emails so I'm not sure I would pay the monthly for this one. But the functionality is pretty great, especially the image personalisation features. I've briefly tried Snov.io and Lemlist seems a bit better than that, so I'm happy to reccomend it.</p><p></p><p></p><p></p><p></p><h3 id="findthatlead">Getting email addresses for cold emails: FindThatLead</h3><p></p><p></p><figure class="wp-block-image size-large"><figure class="wp-image-4964"><img loading="lazy" src="https://dunctk.github.io/media/posts/19/Screenshot-2021-12-08-at-12.22.33-1024x981.png" sizes="100vw" srcset="https://dunctk.github.io/media/posts/19/responsive/Screenshot-2021-12-08-at-12.22.33-1024x981-xs.png 300w, https://dunctk.github.io/media/posts/19/responsive/Screenshot-2021-12-08-at-12.22.33-1024x981-sm.png 480w, https://dunctk.github.io/media/posts/19/responsive/Screenshot-2021-12-08-at-12.22.33-1024x981-md.png 768w, https://dunctk.github.io/media/posts/19/responsive/Screenshot-2021-12-08-at-12.22.33-1024x981-lg.png 1024w, https://dunctk.github.io/media/posts/19/responsive/Screenshot-2021-12-08-at-12.22.33-1024x981-xl.png 1360w, https://dunctk.github.io/media/posts/19/responsive/Screenshot-2021-12-08-at-12.22.33-1024x981-2xl.png 1600w" alt=""></figure></figure><p></p><p></p><p>If you're going to be sending cold emails, you need some emails. <a href="https://findthatlead.com/pricing#_r_ulg256" data-type="URL" data-id="https://findthatlead.com/pricing#_r_ulg256" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">FindThatLead</a> is a one of those tools a bit like Hunter.io.

Recently they added a feature similar to Builtwith, where you can search by specific technology (e.g Shopify) used on a website, then get contact info for the site owners. Buitwith charge a lot more for this feautre, so it does make <a href="https://findthatlead.com/pricing#_r_ulg256" data-type="URL" data-id="https://findthatlead.com/pricing#_r_ulg256" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">FindThatLead</a> seem better value.</p><p></p><p></p><p></p><p></p><h2>SEO</h2><p></p><p></p><h3 id="ahrefs">SEO Strategy: Ahrefs</h3><p></p><p></p><figure class="wp-block-image size-large"><figure class="wp-image-4963"><img loading="lazy" src="https://dunctk.github.io/media/posts/19/Screenshot-2021-12-06-at-17.06.41-1024x856.png" sizes="100vw" srcset="https://dunctk.github.io/media/posts/19/responsive/Screenshot-2021-12-06-at-17.06.41-1024x856-xs.png 300w, https://dunctk.github.io/media/posts/19/responsive/Screenshot-2021-12-06-at-17.06.41-1024x856-sm.png 480w, https://dunctk.github.io/media/posts/19/responsive/Screenshot-2021-12-06-at-17.06.41-1024x856-md.png 768w, https://dunctk.github.io/media/posts/19/responsive/Screenshot-2021-12-06-at-17.06.41-1024x856-lg.png 1024w, https://dunctk.github.io/media/posts/19/responsive/Screenshot-2021-12-06-at-17.06.41-1024x856-xl.png 1360w, https://dunctk.github.io/media/posts/19/responsive/Screenshot-2021-12-06-at-17.06.41-1024x856-2xl.png 1600w" alt=""></figure></figure><p></p><p></p><p><a href="http://ahrefs.com/" data-type="URL" data-id="ahrefs.com/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Ahrefs</a> is hands down the best SEO tool I've tried.
