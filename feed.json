At the time, their previous provider was unable to provide the content that had been uploaded over the years in an accessible and transferable format.</p>\n<p><!-- /wp:paragraph --></p>\n<p><!-- wp:paragraph --></p>\n<p>So what they were left to do was look at bringing in a number of temporary staff to manually download and copy content into a format suitable for the new platform. It was even unclear whether it would be possible to download content in this way, as there were a number of mechanisms designed to stop this (even though they had the rights to their own content).</p>\n<p><!-- /wp:paragraph --></p>\n<p><!-- wp:paragraph --></p>\n<p>What I was able to do was create a script using Python and a web scraping library called <a href=\"https://www.selenium.dev/\" data-type=\"URL\" data-id=\"https://www.selenium.dev/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener\">Selenium</a>, which systematically crawled the legacy system, and stored the content in a database.</p>\n<p><!-- /wp:paragraph --></p>\n<p><!-- wp:paragraph --></p>\n<p>I then added to this another script which connected with the API of the new platform, and with some checks in between, uploaded the content to the appropriate locations on this new LMS system.</p>\n<p><!-- /wp:paragraph --></p>\n<p><!-- wp:generateblocks/headline {\"uniqueId\":\"766a1b41\",\"element\":\"h3\"} --></p>\n<h3 class=\"gb-headline gb-headline-766a1b41 gb-headline-text\">Content Creation</h3>\n<p><!-- /wp:generateblocks/headline --></p>\n<p><!-- wp:paragraph --></p>\n<p>My background is in content creation in multiple forms.

'Quiz' reminds me of all those tacky Facebook 'what type of Disney princess are you?' type quizzes.

It's very simple to get started with, and has a variety of themes to give each lead generation quiz you create with it a different look and feel. The flexibility in terms of visual customization isn't huge, so anyone in the know would definietly still recognise it as being built with Typeform, but it is still quite attractive.</p>\n<p>\n<!-- /wp:paragraph --></p>\n<p><!-- wp:heading {\"level\":3} --></p>\n<h3>LeadsHook</h3>\n<p>\n<!-- /wp:heading --></p>\n<p><!-- wp:paragraph --></p>\n<p>LeadsHook is the most flexibile software out there for lead generation surveys. I've spoken to Nik, the founder of LeadsHook several times, and he would be a bit pissed off to hear me calling LeadsHook 'quiz software'. He prefers the term 'decision tree' or 'personalized lead magnet', because the capabilities go far beyond creating a simple quiz.</p>\n<p>\n<!-- /wp:paragraph --></p>\n<p><!-- wp:paragraph --></p>\n<p><a href=\"https://www.leadshook.com?aff=167\">LeadsHook</a> can be used to create everything from a simple opt in form, up to complex financial calculators that can be sold as their own software product to enterprise companies.</p>\n<p>\n<!-- /wp:paragraph --></p>\n<p><!-- wp:paragraph --></p>\n<p>I've personally used LeadsHook to create a solar panel cost calculator for the UK, which includes functions such as getting accurate solar irradiance data from an API, and verifying the leads phone number in realtime using two factor authentication.</p>\n<p>\n<!-- /wp:paragraph --></p>\n<p><!-- wp:paragraph --></p>\n<p><strong>Conculsion:</strong></p>\n<p>\n<!-- /wp:paragraph --></p>\n<p><!-- wp:paragraph --></p>\n<p>The best overall quiz software for lead generation. You can create extremely advanced lead generation surveys, making use of external APIs, inbuilt calculations, whilst also having a lot of deisgn freedom. They even have a 'custom page node' that allows you to code an entire custom web page inside one of their quizzes. If you're serious about lead generation, <a href=\"https://www.leadshook.com?aff=167\" data-type=\"URL\" data-id=\"https://www.leadshook.com?aff=167\">LeadsHook</a> is hands down the way to go, but it is a bit of a learning curve.</p>\n<p>\n<!-- /wp:paragraph --></p>\n",

It can also be very expensive if you need lots of high end animation done.</p>\n<p>\n<!-- /wp:paragraph --></p>\n<p><!-- wp:paragraph --></p>\n<p>Some companies offer this as part of their standard video production service, but it can also be purchased separately.</p>\n<p>\n<!-- /wp:paragraph --></p>\n<p><!-- wp:paragraph --></p>\n<p>This is worth doing some research on if you are planning to include this in your project, because the costs can vary dramatically depending on how long and complex they need to be.</p>\n<p>\n<!-- /wp:paragraph --></p>\n<p><!-- wp:heading --></p>\n<h2>Animation or Motion Graphics?</h2>\n<p>\n<!-- /wp:heading --></p>\n<p><!-- wp:heading {\"level\":3} --></p>\n<h3>How much does animation cost per minute?</h3>\n<p>\n<!-- /wp:heading --></p>\n<p><!-- wp:paragraph --></p>\n<p>The costs associated with motion graphics animations vary depending on how complex they are and whether they're being created from scratch by a professional animator or using stock footage instead.
