<p><!-- wp:paragraph --></p>
<p>Working on systems that involve people has always been an area where I enjoy working, and since before university I have built various projects using code. My journey into marketing has been via content creation in different forms.</p>

<h2>Marketing Systems Map</h2>
<p><!-- /wp:heading --></p>
<p><!-- wp:paragraph --></p>
<p>Part of systems thinking is look for ways to create positive feedback loops.</p>
<p><!-- /wp:paragraph --></p>
<p><!-- wp:paragraph --></p>
<p>To help with this, I've created this simple map of common opportunities for positive marketing feedback loops:</p>

<p><a href="https://solar4good.co.uk/" data-type="URL" data-id="https://solar4good.co.uk/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Solar4Good</a> is a UK based solar panel and renewable energy installation company. I have worked with them across the marketing stack, building automations to increase their lead to sale rate, as well as generating inbound leads using Google Ads and YouTube Ads.</p>
<p><!-- /wp:paragraph --></p>
<p><!-- wp:paragraph --></p>
<p>They initially reached out to work together before they had entered the UK market, previously having built similar businesses in the US and Australia.</p>
<p><!-- /wp:paragraph --></p>
<p><!-- wp:paragraph --></p>
<p>I implemented <a href="https://gohighlevel.com/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">HighLevel</a> as their marketing automation platform and CMS, which we use for email, SMS, phone calls, and project management post sale.</p>
<p><!-- /wp:paragraph --></p>
<p><!-- wp:paragraph --></p>
<p>Within <a href="https://gohighlevel.com/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">HighLevel</a> I have built multiple automation sequences, including automated calendar booking to boost their lead to appointment rate.</p>
<p><!-- /wp:paragraph --></p>
<p><!-- wp:paragraph --></p>
<p>Using Python scripting, I have built an integration with their solar system design software, <a href="https://opensolar.com" data-type="URL" data-id="https://opensolar.com" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">OpenSolar</a>, so that project information can be pulled through into GoHighLevel and used for marketing sequences.</p>

<p><a href="https://cfauk.org" data-type="URL" data-id="https://cfauk.org" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">CFA UK</a> is the UK organisation of the Chartered Financial Analysts Society.</p>
<p><!-- /wp:paragraph --></p>
<p><!-- wp:paragraph --></p>
<p>I helped them build automations to migrate from their legacy Learning Management System to their new implementation of the <a href="https://www.fuseuniversal.com/" data-type="URL" data-id="https://www.fuseuniversal.com/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Fuse</a> LMS.</p>

<p><!-- /wp:paragraph --></p>
<p><!-- wp:list --></p>
<ul>
<li>Used Python scripts to scrape the front end of their legacy system to extract content and data.</li>
<li>Integrated with Fuse's API to bulk import saved content</li>
<li>Building automated reporting scripts (Python, HTML, APIs)</li>
</ul>
<p><!-- /wp:list --></p>
<p><!-- wp:paragraph --></p>
<p>This role was split between setting up and maintaining the new LMS, pulling data for reporting, and also content creation / curation.</p>

<h3>SEO</h3>
<p><!-- /wp:heading --></p>
<p><!-- wp:paragraph --></p>
<p>I believe an understanding of the principles of SEO is important.</p>
<p><!-- /wp:paragraph --></p>
<p><!-- wp:paragraph --></p>
<p><span style="text-decoration: underline;">For me, those principles are essentially:</span></p>
<p><!-- /wp:paragraph --></p>
<p><!-- wp:list --></p>
<ul>
<li>Create excellent content for humans</li>
<li>Make sure robots can understand it</li>
<li>Structure content around a map of topics and sub-topics, so that:
<ul>
<li>Robots see that you are covering a large topic in detail (topical relevance / knowledge graph)</li>
<li>Humans find it easy to explore your content and get value from it</li>
</ul>
</li>
</ul>
<p><!-- /wp:list --></p>
<p><!-- wp:paragraph --></p>
<p>I practice this on my site UpLevel Green. It's focused on helping people learn more about solar panels. At the time of writing, over 2,000 people a month discover it via Google.</p>

<h3>Programming: Python, HTML, APIs</h3>
<p><!-- /wp:heading --></p>
<p><!-- wp:paragraph --></p>
<p>Whilst I have created a number of simple web apps as personal projects, my main application of coding professionally has been in automating repetitive tasks, or connecting different marketing systems together.</p>
<p><!-- /wp:paragraph --></p>
<p><!-- wp:paragraph --></p>
<p><strong>For example, at CFA UK</strong>, I first came on board as they were moving from their legacy Learning Management System (LMS) to a new one, <a href="https://www.fuseuniversal.com/" data-type="URL" data-id="https://www.fuseuniversal.com/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">FUSE</a>. At the time, their previous provider was unable to provide the content that had been uploaded over the years in an accessible and transferable format.</p>
<p><!-- /wp:paragraph --></p>
<p><!-- wp:paragraph --></p>
<p>So what they were left to do was look at bringing in a number of temporary staff to manually download and copy content into a format suitable for the new platform. It was even unclear whether it would be possible to download content in this way, as there were a number of mechanisms designed to stop this (even though they had the rights to their own content).</p>
<p><!-- /wp:paragraph --></p>
<p><!-- wp:paragraph --></p>
<p>What I was able to do was create a script using Python and a web scraping library called <a href="https://www.selenium.dev/" data-type="URL" data-id="https://www.selenium.dev/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Selenium</a>, which systematically crawled the legacy system, and stored the content in a database.</p>
<p><!-- /wp:paragraph --></p>
<p><!-- wp:paragraph --></p>
<p>I then added to this another script which connected with the API of the new platform, and with some checks in between, uploaded the content to the appropriate locations on this new LMS system.</p>
<p><!-- /wp:paragraph --></p>
<p><!-- wp:generateblocks/headline {"uniqueId":"766a1b41","element":"h3"} --></p>
<h3 class="gb-headline gb-headline-766a1b41 gb-headline-text">Content Creation</h3>
<p><!-- /wp:generateblocks/headline --></p>
<p><!-- wp:paragraph --></p>
<p>My background is in content creation in multiple forms. I got my degree in <a href="https://www.uca.ac.uk/study/courses/ba-film-production/" data-type="URL" data-id="https://www.uca.ac.uk/study/courses/ba-film-production/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Film Production BA(Hons)</a> from the <a href="https://www.uca.ac.uk/" data-type="URL" data-id="https://www.uca.ac.uk/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">University for the Creative Arts</a>, and then worked a freelancer for a number of different marketing agencies and production companies.</p>
<p><!-- /wp:paragraph --></p>
<p><!-- wp:paragraph --></p>
<p>Here are <a href="http://photonicgrowth.com/portfolio/" data-type="URL" data-id="photonicgrowth.com/portfolio/">some examples of my content production work</a>.</p>
<p><!-- /wp:paragraph --></p>
<p><!-- wp:paragraph --></p>
<p>This started out as purely video content, but then over time I grew experience of more of the marketing stack.</p>

<p>Considering using quizzes for lead generation? Using lead generation quizzes / surveys is a super effective way to generate more targeted leads, whilst also increasing the quality of the leads you're generating.</p>
<p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph --></p>
<p><!-- wp:paragraph --></p>
<p>Survey lead generation also allows you to provide value earlier on in the relationship with leads &amp; potential customers, by creating interactive web page lead magnets based on the information they enter.</p>
<p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph --></p>
<p><!-- wp:heading --></p>
<h2>Why Use Surveys for Lead Generation?</h2>
<p>
<!-- /wp:heading --></p>
<p><!-- wp:paragraph --></p>
<p>Using surveys for lead generation gives you an edge on your competition by giving potential customers a more compelling reason to share their information with you and begin a relationship with your brand.</p>
<p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph --></p>
<p><!-- wp:heading --></p>
<h2>What is the Difference Between a Quiz and a Survey for Lead Generation?</h2>
<p>
<!-- /wp:heading --></p>
<p><!-- wp:paragraph --></p>
<p>For our purpose - lead generation, there isn't really a difference between a survey and a quiz.</p>
<p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph --></p>
<p><!-- wp:paragraph --></p>
<p>Personally, I don't like either term. 'Quiz' reminds me of all those tacky Facebook 'what type of Disney princess are you?' type quizzes. And 'survey' sounds like an annoying form companies ask you to fill out about your 'customer service experience', which always leave me thinking 'what's in it for me?'.</p>
<p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph --></p>
<p><!-- wp:paragraph --></p>
<p>But the more accurate term 'decision tree marketing' doesn't exactly roll of the tounge either, so quiz or survey is here to stay.</p>
<p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph --></p>
<p><!-- wp:paragraph --></p>
<p>The important thing is that you're going to be asking questions that qualify the lead, and also typically provide them with some value in return.</p>
<p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph --></p>
<p><!-- wp:heading --></p>
<h2>Quiz Software for Lead Generation Compared</h2>
<p>
<!-- /wp:heading --></p>
<p><!-- wp:heading {"level":3} --></p>
<h3>TypeForm</h3>
<p>
<!-- /wp:heading --></p>
<p><!-- wp:paragraph --></p>
<p>Typeform is able to create simple quizzes, with scores and basic logic such as simple math calculations. It's very simple to get started with, and has a variety of themes to give each lead generation quiz you create with it a different look and feel. The flexibility in terms of visual customization isn't huge, so anyone in the know would definietly still recognise it as being built with Typeform, but it is still quite attractive.</p>
<p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph --></p>
<p><!-- wp:heading {"level":3} --></p>
<h3>LeadsHook</h3>
<p>
<!-- /wp:heading --></p>
<p><!-- wp:paragraph --></p>
<p>LeadsHook is the most flexibile software out there for lead generation surveys. I've spoken to Nik, the founder of LeadsHook several times, and he would be a bit pissed off to hear me calling LeadsHook 'quiz software'. He prefers the term 'decision tree' or 'personalized lead magnet', because the capabilities go far beyond creating a simple quiz.</p>
<p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph --></p>
<p><!-- wp:paragraph --></p>
<p><a href="https://www.leadshook.com?aff=167">LeadsHook</a> can be used to create everything from a simple opt in form, up to complex financial calculators that can be sold as their own software product to enterprise companies.</p>
<p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph --></p>
<p><!-- wp:paragraph --></p>
<p>I've personally used LeadsHook to create a solar panel cost calculator for the UK, which includes functions such as getting accurate solar irradiance data from an API, and verifying the leads phone number in realtime using two factor authentication.</p>
<p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph --></p>
<p><!-- wp:paragraph --></p>
<p><strong>Conculsion:</strong></p>
<p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph --></p>
<p><!-- wp:paragraph --></p>
<p>The best overall quiz software for lead generation. You can create extremely advanced lead generation surveys, making use of external APIs, inbuilt calculations, whilst also having a lot of deisgn freedom. They even have a 'custom page node' that allows you to code an entire custom web page inside one of their quizzes. If you're serious about lead generation, <a href="https://www.leadshook.com?aff=167" data-type="URL" data-id="https://www.leadshook.com?aff=167">LeadsHook</a> is hands down the way to go, but it is a bit of a learning curve.</p>

<p>This case study details the process and results that I used to create successful YouTube ads for a SaaS app that sits halfway between B2B and B2C in the Cryptocurrency trading space. I've had to censor some of the commercially sensitive data, but it should still provide useful insights if you're considering YouTube ads as a way to generate leads and signups for your SaaS.</p>
<p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph --></p>
<p><!-- wp:heading --></p>
<h2>The company</h2>
<p>
<!-- /wp:heading --></p>
<p><!-- wp:paragraph --></p>
<p>A bootstrapped SaaS Tool in the Cryptocurrency trading niche, with a team of 30. </p>
<p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph --></p>
<p><!-- wp:heading --></p>
<h2>Situation before</h2>
<p>
<!-- /wp:heading --></p>
<p><!-- wp:paragraph --></p>
<p>Google search ads worked sporadiclly due to heavy handed algo bans, organic SEO was good, but they wanted a way to be able to grow quicker and capture more of the market in an expanding niche, before well funded competitors got there first.</p>
<p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph --></p>
<p><!-- wp:heading --></p>
<h2>What we worked on</h2>
<p>
<!-- /wp:heading --></p>
<p><!-- wp:paragraph --></p>
<p>YouTube ads for a particular geographic region of focus</p>
<p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph --></p>
<p><!-- wp:heading --></p>
<h2>What would success look like? </h2>
<p>
<!-- /wp:heading --></p>
<p><!-- wp:paragraph --></p>
<p>Generating sign ups for a similar or lower price to what they are able to get with Google Search Ads, but with a cold audience</p>
<p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph --></p>
<p><!-- wp:heading --></p>
<h2>Process</h2>
<p>
<!-- /wp:heading --></p>
<p><!-- wp:heading {"level":3} --></p>
<h3>Script Writing</h3>
<p>
<!-- /wp:heading --></p>
<p><!-- wp:paragraph --></p>
<p>I wrote three scripts, with versions of each excluding the terms "crypto" and similar, in case the algorithm picked up on those and rejected the ads (even though the company was actually fully compliant with Google Ads policy on cryptocurrency, the algo often has false positives).</p>
<p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph --></p>
<p><!-- wp:paragraph --></p>
<p>It's important to have at least three variations so that you can start to test different ideas. </p>
<p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph --></p>
<p><!-- wp:paragraph --></p>
<p>On a larger budget and with more time, I would also test out more variables such as presenter (male or female, accent, etc), filming background and lighting (indoors, outdoors, plain background vs office setup, shaky iPhone video vs pro filming), music, and many others. </p>
<p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph --></p>
<p><!-- wp:heading {"level":3} --></p>
<h3>Hiring a Presenter</h3>
<p>
<!-- /wp:heading --></p>
<p><!-- wp:paragraph --></p>
<p>I've found that having an on camera presenter typically gets better results than only having a voice over on top of motion graphics or stock footage.</p>
<p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph --></p>
<p><!-- wp:paragraph --></p>
<p>There's a number of presenters I've worked with in the past who have their own home studio. In this case I needed to find a 'millenial' looking presenter who had an Australian accent. </p>
<p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph --></p>
<p><!-- wp:paragraph --></p>
<p>There's several freelance marketplaces one can use to find preseneter talent, in this case I used Fiverr. </p>

<p>In any kind of filmmaking, the principle "show, don't tell" rules supreme. </p>
<p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph --></p>
<p><!-- wp:paragraph --></p>
<p>In this case, I decided to show specific flows from the app in a simplified, very clear way that communicates the value of the tool quickly. </p>
<p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph --></p>
<p><!-- wp:paragraph --></p>
<p>The process of adding motion graphics and working to a final edit took a couple of days, but the results were really worth it.</p>

<h3>Ads Campaign Setup</h3>

<figure class="wp-block-image"><img loading="lazy" alt=""/></figure>
<p>
<!-- /wp:image --></p>
<p><!-- wp:paragraph --></p>
<p>We wanted to test different audiences, and with input from the company's Head of Growth, I added in some audiences that he wanted to test. </p>
<p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph --></p>
<p><!-- wp:paragraph --></p>
<p>When starting out with YouTube ads, my preference is to go with Placement targeting first of all. That means manually selecting a list of videos and channels that your ideal customers are highly likely to be watching.</p>
<p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph --></p>
<p><!-- wp:paragraph --></p>
<p>My criteria when starting out is: </p>
<p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph --></p>
<p><!-- wp:list --></p>
<ul>
<li>Channels: are 80% or more of the videos on the channel likely to be viewed by our ideal customers?</li>
<li>Videos: same criteria, but try to select whole channels if possible. Check to see if the video appears to still be getting a reasonable number of views (otherwise there won't be enough people to show ads to). </li>
</ul>
<p>
<!-- /wp:list --></p>
<p><!-- wp:paragraph --></p>
<p>I spent several hours researching the cryptocurrency landscape on YouTube, and built a placement list which I felt was well targeted. </p>
<p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph --></p>
<p><!-- wp:paragraph --></p>
<p>I also selected a 3 day site visitor audience for retargeting, and another one based off YouTube keywords which are very specific to the problem that this product solves within the crypto space (again, I wish I could be more specific here but I don't want to reveal anything commercially sensitive).</p>
<p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph --></p>
<p><!-- wp:paragraph --></p>
<p>Many of these channels are ones where the company has tried to get in video sponserships but the fees asked for by the influencers were deemed to be too high by the company. This way, we get the benefits of these influencers specific audiences, but without negotiations, wait time, and high sponsership fees.</p>
<p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph --></p>
<p><!-- wp:heading {"level":3} --></p>
<h3>Results</h3>
<p>
<!-- /wp:heading --></p>
<p><!-- wp:image {"id":4587,"sizeSlug":"large","linkDestination":"none"} --></p>
<figure class="wp-block-image size-large"><figure class="wp-image-4587"><img loading="lazy" src="https://dunctk.github.io/media/posts/8/results-1-1024x439.png" sizes="100vw" srcset="https://dunctk.github.io/media/posts/8/responsive/results-1-1024x439-xs.png 300w ,https://dunctk.github.io/media/posts/8/responsive/results-1-1024x439-sm.png 480w ,https://dunctk.github.io/media/posts/8/responsive/results-1-1024x439-md.png 768w ,https://dunctk.github.io/media/posts/8/responsive/results-1-1024x439-lg.png 1024w ,https://dunctk.github.io/media/posts/8/responsive/results-1-1024x439-xl.png 1360w ,https://dunctk.github.io/media/posts/8/responsive/results-1-1024x439-2xl.png 1600w"  alt="" /></figure></figure>
<p>
<!-- /wp:image --></p>
<p><!-- wp:paragraph --></p>
<p>In the inital 7 day campaign (based around an event happening in the Crypto space), we were able to generate 118 direct sign ups, plus an additional 39 'view through conversions', which is people who didn't click 'sign up' in the YouTube ad but instead visited the website directly or through Google later and then signed up.</p>
<p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph --></p>
<p><!-- wp:paragraph --></p>
<p><strong>The cost per conversion was 30% lower</strong> than the benchmark for what the business was happy to pay to aquire a signup (based on their back end LTV calcs), for the campaigns that 'won' in testing. Including the testing budget, the cost per signup was in line with the benchmark. </p>
<p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph --></p>
<p><!-- wp:paragraph --></p>
<p><strong>The cost per sign up was 37% lower </strong>compared to Google Search Ads over the same time period.</p>
<p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph --></p>
<p><!-- wp:heading {"level":3} --></p>
<h3>Conclusion </h3>
<p>
<!-- /wp:heading --></p>
<p><!-- wp:paragraph --></p>
<p>After the initial 7 day campaign, the results are very encouraging. Typically YouTube ads take more experimentation and time to get good ROI, but in this case they worked well right out of the gate. </p>
<p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph --></p>
<p><!-- wp:paragraph --></p>
<p>The key here is that the product already has good product market fit, and has an offer which is suitable for paid traffic. I write more about this in my guide to YouTube ads for B2B. </p>

<h3>How do you calculate video editing costs?</h3>

<!-- /wp:heading --></p>
<p><!-- wp:paragraph --></p>
<p>There's several variables which can change how much video editing costs, such as:</p>
<p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph --></p>
<p><!-- wp:list --></p>
<ul>
<li>Do you want to work with a freelance video editor or a company that provides post production services?</li>
<li>Type - There's several different types of videos you can choose from when making a video which will alter how long they take to create.</li>

<li>How much raw footage will they need to work with?</li>
<li>Do you want them to source music and stock footage for you, or do you already have some in mind?</li>

<li>How about subtitles in different languages?</li>
<li>How much creative input are you expecting from them - are you looking for them to help create a compelling story from source material, or go through a standard process to create the finished product?</li>

<p><!-- wp:paragraph --></p>
<p>All this can sometimes seem a bit overwhelming, so let me break it down into simple steps...</p>
<p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph --></p>
<p><!-- wp:heading {"level":3} --></p>
<h3>Video Length</h3>
<p>
<!-- /wp:heading --></p>
<p><!-- wp:heading {"level":3} --></p>
<h3>How much does it cost to edit a 10 minute video?</h3>
<p>
<!-- /wp:heading --></p>
<p><!-- wp:paragraph --></p>
<p>If you want to make a simple video which will be uploaded and shared on the web, then you can hire someone for as little as $30 per hour. However at this level, expect to be working with a student or someone who is not a very experienced editor.</p>
<p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph --></p>
<p><!-- wp:paragraph --></p>
<p>If your project is more complicated than that - such as live streaming or high end effects like slow motion footage or animation - how much does it cost?</p>
<p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph --></p>
<p><!-- wp:paragraph --></p>
<p>Professional video editing rates are often in the $50-150 per hour range, or $400-800 per day on a daily rate.</p>
<p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph --></p>
<p><!-- wp:heading --></p>
<h2>Motion Graphics</h2>
<p>
<!-- /wp:heading --></p>
<p><!-- wp:paragraph --></p>
<p>How much does it cost to hire a motion graphics artist?</p>
<p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph --></p>
<p><!-- wp:paragraph --></p>
<p>Motion Graphics is an incredibly popular aspect of the video editing process, and one that many people are opting for in their projects. It can also be very expensive if you need lots of high end animation done.</p>
<p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph --></p>
<p><!-- wp:paragraph --></p>
<p>Some companies offer this as part of their standard video production service, but it can also be purchased separately.</p>
<p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph --></p>
<p><!-- wp:paragraph --></p>
<p>This is worth doing some research on if you are planning to include this in your project, because the costs can vary dramatically depending on how long and complex they need to be.</p>
<p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph --></p>
<p><!-- wp:heading --></p>
<h2>Animation or Motion Graphics?</h2>
<p>
<!-- /wp:heading --></p>
<p><!-- wp:heading {"level":3} --></p>
<h3>How much does animation cost per minute?</h3>
<p>
<!-- /wp:heading --></p>
<p><!-- wp:paragraph --></p>
<p>The costs associated with motion graphics animations vary depending on how complex they are and whether they're being created from scratch by a professional animator or using stock footage instead. If its high end / highly detailed products which will require multiple angles/shots in order to create them, then expect your budget needs looking at! :)&nbsp;</p>
<p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph --></p>
<p><!-- wp:paragraph --></p>
<p>If you're developing a video that will require lots of animations (such as an explainer video), then hiring professional animators could end up costing more than $100/minute - which quickly adds up when there's only 30 seconds of footage!</p>
<p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph --></p>
<p><!-- wp:paragraph --></p>
<p>A quick way to estimate what kind of budget needs looking at is based purely off length: If your finished product comes out longer than 60 seconds, I would recommend adding 'animation' to your list of things to look into.</p>
<p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph --></p>
<p><!-- wp:heading {"level":3} --></p>
<h3>How much do you need to pay for a logo intro?</h3>
<p>
<!-- /wp:heading --></p>
<p><!-- wp:paragraph --></p>
<p>Logo intros are a great way to add an extra bit of impact and branding to your video, but they can also be expensive.</p>
<p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph --></p>
<p><!-- wp:paragraph --></p>
<p>Logos can be as simple as adding text and applying basic effects such as color correction - but if you want something more advanced like animation, it's going to cost you.</p>
<p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph --></p>
<p><!-- wp:paragraph --></p>
<p>If all you need is a simple logo reveal with an overlay, this can be done for as little as $20-30 per video - but expect the price to go up if there are lots of effects or color corrections needed too.</p>
<p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph --></p>
<p><!-- wp:heading {"level":3} --></p>
<h3>How much does stock footage cost?</h3>
<p>
<!-- /wp:heading --></p>
<p><!-- wp:paragraph --></p>
<p>Stock footage is often used for background shots or establishing scenes which will come before any dialogue starts taking place in the video. &nbsp;However if you're looking for specific types (such as nature or aerial), then this will become even more costly than hiring out professional editors! &nbsp;</p>
<p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph --></p>
<p><!-- wp:heading {"level":3} --></p>
<h3>Do I have any rights issues that might affect my video editing budget?</h3>
<p>
<!-- /wp:heading --></p>
<p><!-- wp:paragraph --></p>
<p>If there's music or other types of footage involved in the project, it may be worth getting legal advice before going ahead - especially if you want these elements included at no extra cost. This will prevent unnecessary surprises and costs further down the line. If they are not willing to make changes based on a suggestion from a third party, then this should also give you an indication about their ability as a creative professional.&nbsp;</p>
<p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph --></p>
<p><!-- wp:paragraph --></p>
<p>A good way to get around some potential pitfalls is through using royalty free stock footage or images instead of original content wherever possible - which won't cost the earth.</p>

<p><a href="https://www.leadshook.com/?aff=167" data-type="URL" data-id="https://www.leadshook.com/?aff=167">Leadshook</a> is a platform for creating interactive lead magnets. At least how that's I've used it. It's actually more versatile than that, and can be used across all parts of a business.</p>
<p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph --></p>
<p><!-- wp:paragraph --></p>
<p>The way I've used it is to create personalised and interactive tools to attract leads. For example, this <a rel="noreferrer noopener" href="https://uplevelgreen.com/solar-panel-calculator/" data-type="URL" data-id="https://uplevelgreen.com/solar-panel-calculator/" target="_blank">solar panel cost calculator</a>, which helps people in the UK decide if solar panels are worth it for them (only works for UK addresses right now). </p>
<p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph --></p>
<p><!-- wp:paragraph --></p>
<p>I've found it to be incredibly valuable, and the main reasons I've stuck with it over other tools are:</p>
<p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph --></p>
<p><!-- wp:list --></p>
<ul>
<li>It's incredibly flexible, you can build whatever you want </li>
<li>It's built by an experienced marketer so the functionality all makes sense for digital marketing (compared to 'survey' tools)</li>
<li>The community is probably the best out of any SaaS product, and the founder Nik is fantastic at taking time to help people get results with the software - better coaching than $2,000 digital marketing courses</li>
</ul>

<p><a href="https://lemlist.com" data-type="URL" data-id="https://lemlist.com">Lemlist</a> is one of those tools I orginally got in an AppSumo lifetime deal, and I'm really glad I did. They've seriously worked on it and improved since the orginal AppSumo deal. Personally I don't send very many cold emails so I'm not sure I would pay the monthly for this one. But the functionality is pretty great, especially the image personalisation features. I've briefly tried Snov.io and Lemlist seems a bit better than that, so I'm happy to reccomend it.</p>

<p>If you're going to be sending cold emails, you need some emails. <a href="https://findthatlead.com/pricing#_r_ulg256" data-type="URL" data-id="https://findthatlead.com/pricing#_r_ulg256" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">FindThatLead</a> is a one of those tools a bit like Hunter.io. To be honest, all the tools I've tested for this are bit hit and miss, but <a href="https://findthatlead.com/pricing#_r_ulg256" data-type="URL" data-id="https://findthatlead.com/pricing#_r_ulg256" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">FindThatLead</a> is as good as any, and it's the one I have the most experience with. Recently they added a feature similar to Builtwith, where you can search by specific technology (e.g Shopify) used on a website, then get contact info for the site owners. Buitwith charge a lot more for this feautre, so it does make <a href="https://findthatlead.com/pricing#_r_ulg256" data-type="URL" data-id="https://findthatlead.com/pricing#_r_ulg256" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">FindThatLead</a> seem better value.</p>
