<p><!-- /wp:paragraph --></p>
<p><!-- wp:paragraph --></p>
<p>Working on systems that involve people has always been an area where I enjoy working, and since before university I have built various projects using code. My journey into marketing has been via content creation in different forms.</p>

<h2>Marketing Systems Map</h2>
<p><!-- /wp:heading --></p>
<p><!-- wp:paragraph --></p>
<p>Part of systems thinking is look for ways to create positive feedback loops.</p>
<p><!-- /wp:paragraph --></p>
<p><!-- wp:paragraph --></p>
<p>To help with this, I've created this simple map of common opportunities for positive marketing feedback loops:</p>

<p><a href="https://solar4good.co.uk/" data-type="URL" data-id="https://solar4good.co.uk/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Solar4Good</a> is a UK based solar panel and renewable energy installation company. I have worked with them across the marketing stack, building automations to increase their lead to sale rate, as well as generating inbound leads using Google Ads and YouTube Ads.</p>
<p><!-- /wp:paragraph --></p>
<p><!-- wp:paragraph --></p>
<p>They initially reached out to work together before they had entered the UK market, previously having built similar businesses in the US and Australia.</p>
<p><!-- /wp:paragraph --></p>
<p><!-- wp:paragraph --></p>
<p>I implemented <a href="https://gohighlevel.com/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">HighLevel</a> as their marketing automation platform and CMS, which we use for email, SMS, phone calls, and project management post sale.</p>
<p><!-- /wp:paragraph --></p>
<p><!-- wp:paragraph --></p>
<p>Within <a href="https://gohighlevel.com/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">HighLevel</a> I have built multiple automation sequences, including automated calendar booking to boost their lead to appointment rate.</p>
<p><!-- /wp:paragraph --></p>
<p><!-- wp:paragraph --></p>
<p>Using Python scripting, I have built an integration with their solar system design software, <a href="https://opensolar.com" data-type="URL" data-id="https://opensolar.com" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">OpenSolar</a>, so that project information can be pulled through into GoHighLevel and used for marketing sequences.</p>

<p><a href="https://cfauk.org" data-type="URL" data-id="https://cfauk.org" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">CFA UK</a> is the UK organisation of the Chartered Financial Analysts Society.</p>
<p><!-- /wp:paragraph --></p>
<p><!-- wp:paragraph --></p>
<p>I helped them build automations to migrate from their legacy Learning Management System to their new implementation of the <a href="https://www.fuseuniversal.com/" data-type="URL" data-id="https://www.fuseuniversal.com/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Fuse</a> LMS.</p>
<p><!-- /wp:paragraph --></p>

<p><strong>Automation:</strong></p>
<p><!-- /wp:paragraph --></p>
<p><!-- wp:list --></p>
<ul>
<li>Used Python scripts to scrape the front end of their legacy system to extract content and data.</li>
<li>Integrated with Fuse's API to bulk import saved content</li>
<li>Building automated reporting scripts (Python, HTML, APIs)</li>
</ul>
<p><!-- /wp:list --></p>
<p><!-- wp:paragraph --></p>
<p>This role was split between setting up and maintaining the new LMS, pulling data for reporting, and also content creation / curation.</p>

<p><!-- wp:paragraph --></p>
<p><strong>Content Curation / Creation:</strong></p>

<h3>SEO</h3>
<p><!-- /wp:heading --></p>
<p><!-- wp:paragraph --></p>
<p>I believe an understanding of the principles of SEO is important.</p>
<p><!-- /wp:paragraph --></p>
<p><!-- wp:paragraph --></p>
<p><span style="text-decoration: underline;">For me, those principles are essentially:</span></p>
<p><!-- /wp:paragraph --></p>
<p><!-- wp:list --></p>
<ul>
<li>Create excellent content for humans</li>
<li>Make sure robots can understand it</li>
<li>Structure content around a map of topics and sub-topics, so that:
<ul>
<li>Robots see that you are covering a large topic in detail (topical relevance / knowledge graph)</li>
<li>Humans find it easy to explore your content and get value from it</li>
</ul>
</li>
</ul>
<p><!-- /wp:list --></p>
<p><!-- wp:paragraph --></p>
<p>I practice this on my site UpLevel Green. It's focused on helping people learn more about solar panels. At the time of writing, over 2,000 people a month discover it via Google.</p>

<h3>Programming: Python, HTML, APIs</h3>
<p><!-- /wp:heading --></p>
<p><!-- wp:paragraph --></p>
<p>Whilst I have created a number of simple web apps as personal projects, my main application of coding professionally has been in automating repetitive tasks, or connecting different marketing systems together.</p>
<p><!-- /wp:paragraph --></p>
<p><!-- wp:paragraph --></p>
<p><strong>For example, at CFA UK</strong>, I first came on board as they were moving from their legacy Learning Management System (LMS) to a new one, <a href="https://www.fuseuniversal.com/" data-type="URL" data-id="https://www.fuseuniversal.com/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">FUSE</a>. At the time, their previous provider was unable to provide the content that had been uploaded over the years in an accessible and transferable format.</p>
<p><!-- /wp:paragraph --></p>
<p><!-- wp:paragraph --></p>
<p>So what they were left to do was look at bringing in a number of temporary staff to manually download and copy content into a format suitable for the new platform. It was even unclear whether it would be possible to download content in this way, as there were a number of mechanisms designed to stop this (even though they had the rights to their own content).</p>
<p><!-- /wp:paragraph --></p>
<p><!-- wp:paragraph --></p>
<p>What I was able to do was create a script using Python and a web scraping library called <a href="https://www.selenium.dev/" data-type="URL" data-id="https://www.selenium.dev/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Selenium</a>, which systematically crawled the legacy system, and stored the content in a database.</p>
<p><!-- /wp:paragraph --></p>
<p><!-- wp:paragraph --></p>
<p>I then added to this another script which connected with the API of the new platform, and with some checks in between, uploaded the content to the appropriate locations on this new LMS system.</p>
<p><!-- /wp:paragraph --></p>
<p><!-- wp:generateblocks/headline {"uniqueId":"766a1b41","element":"h3"} --></p>
<h3 class="gb-headline gb-headline-766a1b41 gb-headline-text">Content Creation</h3>
<p><!-- /wp:generateblocks/headline --></p>
<p><!-- wp:paragraph --></p>
<p>My background is in content creation in multiple forms. I got my degree in <a href="https://www.uca.ac.uk/study/courses/ba-film-production/" data-type="URL" data-id="https://www.uca.ac.uk/study/courses/ba-film-production/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Film Production BA(Hons)</a> from the <a href="https://www.uca.ac.uk/" data-type="URL" data-id="https://www.uca.ac.uk/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">University for the Creative Arts</a>, and then worked a freelancer for a number of different marketing agencies and production companies.</p>
<p><!-- /wp:paragraph --></p>
<p><!-- wp:paragraph --></p>
<p>Here are <a href="http://photonicgrowth.com/portfolio/" data-type="URL" data-id="photonicgrowth.com/portfolio/">some examples of my content production work</a>.</p>
<p><!-- /wp:paragraph --></p>
<p><!-- wp:paragraph --></p>
<p>This started out as purely video content, but then over time I grew experience of more of the marketing stack.</p>

<p>Considering using quizzes for lead generation? Using lead generation quizzes / surveys is a super effective way to generate more targeted leads, whilst also increasing the quality of the leads you're generating.</p>
<p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph --></p>
<p><!-- wp:paragraph --></p>
<p>Survey lead generation also allows you to provide value earlier on in the relationship with leads &amp; potential customers, by creating interactive web page lead magnets based on the information they enter.</p>
<p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph --></p>
<p><!-- wp:heading --></p>
<h2>Why Use Surveys for Lead Generation?</h2>
<p>
<!-- /wp:heading --></p>
<p><!-- wp:paragraph --></p>
<p>Using surveys for lead generation gives you an edge on your competition by giving potential customers a more compelling reason to share their information with you and begin a relationship with your brand.</p>
<p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph --></p>
<p><!-- wp:heading --></p>
<h2>What is the Difference Between a Quiz and a Survey for Lead Generation?</h2>
<p>
<!-- /wp:heading --></p>
<p><!-- wp:paragraph --></p>
<p>For our purpose - lead generation, there isn't really a difference between a survey and a quiz.</p>
<p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph --></p>
<p><!-- wp:paragraph --></p>
<p>Personally, I don't like either term. 'Quiz' reminds me of all those tacky Facebook 'what type of Disney princess are you?' type quizzes. And 'survey' sounds like an annoying form companies ask you to fill out about your 'customer service experience', which always leave me thinking 'what's in it for me?'.</p>
<p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph --></p>
<p><!-- wp:paragraph --></p>
<p>But the more accurate term 'decision tree marketing' doesn't exactly roll of the tounge either, so quiz or survey is here to stay.</p>
<p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph --></p>
<p><!-- wp:paragraph --></p>
<p>The important thing is that you're going to be asking questions that qualify the lead, and also typically provide them with some value in return.</p>
<p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph --></p>
<p><!-- wp:heading --></p>
<h2>Quiz Software for Lead Generation Compared</h2>
<p>
<!-- /wp:heading --></p>
<p><!-- wp:heading {"level":3} --></p>
<h3>TypeForm</h3>
<p>
<!-- /wp:heading --></p>
<p><!-- wp:paragraph --></p>
<p>Typeform is able to create simple quizzes, with scores and basic logic such as simple math calculations. It's very simple to get started with, and has a variety of themes to give each lead generation quiz you create with it a different look and feel. The flexibility in terms of visual customization isn't huge, so anyone in the know would definietly still recognise it as being built with Typeform, but it is still quite attractive.</p>
<p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph --></p>
<p><!-- wp:heading {"level":3} --></p>
<h3>LeadsHook</h3>
<p>
<!-- /wp:heading --></p>
<p><!-- wp:paragraph --></p>
<p>LeadsHook is the most flexibile software out there for lead generation surveys. I've spoken to Nik, the founder of LeadsHook several times, and he would be a bit pissed off to hear me calling LeadsHook 'quiz software'. He prefers the term 'decision tree' or 'personalized lead magnet', because the capabilities go far beyond creating a simple quiz.</p>
<p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph --></p>
<p><!-- wp:paragraph --></p>
<p><a href="https://www.leadshook.com?aff=167">LeadsHook</a> can be used to create everything from a simple opt in form, up to complex financial calculators that can be sold as their own software product to enterprise companies.</p>
<p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph --></p>
<p><!-- wp:paragraph --></p>
<p>I've personally used LeadsHook to create a solar panel cost calculator for the UK, which includes functions such as getting accurate solar irradiance data from an API, and verifying the leads phone number in realtime using two factor authentication.</p>
<p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph --></p>
<p><!-- wp:paragraph --></p>
<p><strong>Conculsion:</strong></p>
<p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph --></p>
<p><!-- wp:paragraph --></p>
<p>The best overall quiz software for lead generation. You can create extremely advanced lead generation surveys, making use of external APIs, inbuilt calculations, whilst also having a lot of deisgn freedom. They even have a 'custom page node' that allows you to code an entire custom web page inside one of their quizzes. If you're serious about lead generation, <a href="https://www.leadshook.com?aff=167" data-type="URL" data-id="https://www.leadshook.com?aff=167">LeadsHook</a> is hands down the way to go, but it is a bit of a learning curve.</p>

<p>This case study details the process and results that I used to create successful YouTube ads for a SaaS app that sits halfway between B2B and B2C in the Cryptocurrency trading space. I've had to censor some of the commercially sensitive data, but it should still provide useful insights if you're considering YouTube ads as a way to generate leads and signups for your SaaS.</p>
<p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph --></p>
<p><!-- wp:heading --></p>
<h2>The company</h2>
<p>
<!-- /wp:heading --></p>
<p><!-- wp:paragraph --></p>
<p>A bootstrapped SaaS Tool in the Cryptocurrency trading niche, with a team of 30. </p>
<p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph --></p>
<p><!-- wp:heading --></p>
<h2>Situation before</h2>
<p>
<!-- /wp:heading --></p>
<p><!-- wp:paragraph --></p>
<p>Google search ads worked sporadiclly due to heavy handed algo bans, organic SEO was good, but they wanted a way to be able to grow quicker and capture more of the market in an expanding niche, before well funded competitors got there first.</p>
<p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph --></p>
<p><!-- wp:heading --></p>
<h2>What we worked on</h2>
<p>
<!-- /wp:heading --></p>
<p><!-- wp:paragraph --></p>
<p>YouTube ads for a particular geographic region of focus</p>
<p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph --></p>
<p><!-- wp:heading --></p>
<h2>What would success look like? </h2>
<p>
<!-- /wp:heading --></p>
<p><!-- wp:paragraph --></p>
<p>Generating sign ups for a similar or lower price to what they are able to get with Google Search Ads, but with a cold audience</p>
<p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph --></p>
<p><!-- wp:heading --></p>
<h2>Process</h2>
<p>
<!-- /wp:heading --></p>
<p><!-- wp:heading {"level":3} --></p>
<h3>Script Writing</h3>
<p>
<!-- /wp:heading --></p>
<p><!-- wp:paragraph --></p>
<p>I wrote three scripts, with versions of each excluding the terms "crypto" and similar, in case the algorithm picked up on those and rejected the ads (even though the company was actually fully compliant with Google Ads policy on cryptocurrency, the algo often has false positives).</p>
<p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph --></p>
<p><!-- wp:paragraph --></p>
<p>It's important to have at least three variations so that you can start to test different ideas. </p>
<p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph --></p>
<p><!-- wp:paragraph --></p>
<p>On a larger budget and with more time, I would also test out more variables such as presenter (male or female, accent, etc), filming background and lighting (indoors, outdoors, plain background vs office setup, shaky iPhone video vs pro filming), music, and many others. </p>
<p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph --></p>
<p><!-- wp:heading {"level":3} --></p>
<h3>Hiring a Presenter</h3>
<p>
<!-- /wp:heading --></p>
<p><!-- wp:paragraph --></p>
<p>I've found that having an on camera presenter typically gets better results than only having a voice over on top of motion graphics or stock footage.</p>
<p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph --></p>
<p><!-- wp:paragraph --></p>
<p>There's a number of presenters I've worked with in the past who have their own home studio. In this case I needed to find a 'millenial' looking presenter who had an Australian accent. </p>
<p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph --></p>
<p><!-- wp:paragraph --></p>
<p>There's several freelance marketplaces one can use to find preseneter talent, in this case I used Fiverr. </p>

<p>
<!-- /wp:image --></p>
<p><!-- wp:paragraph --></p>
<p>In any kind of filmmaking, the principle "show, don't tell" rules supreme. </p>
<p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph --></p>
<p><!-- wp:paragraph --></p>
<p>In this case, I decided to show specific flows from the app in a simplified, very clear way that communicates the value of the tool quickly. </p>
<p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph --></p>
<p><!-- wp:paragraph --></p>
<p>The process of adding motion graphics and working to a final edit took a couple of days, but the results were really worth it.</p>

<h3>Ads Campaign Setup</h3>
<p>
<!-- /wp:heading --></p>
<p><!-- wp:image --></p>
<figure class="wp-block-image"><img loading="lazy" alt=""/></figure>
<p>
<!-- /wp:image --></p>
<p><!-- wp:paragraph --></p>
<p>We wanted to test different audiences, and with input from the company's Head of Growth, I added in some audiences that he wanted to test. </p>
<p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph --></p>
<p><!-- wp:paragraph --></p>
<p>When starting out with YouTube ads, my preference is to go with Placement targeting first of all. That means manually selecting a list of videos and channels that your ideal customers are highly likely to be watching.</p>
<p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph --></p>
<p><!-- wp:paragraph --></p>
<p>My criteria when starting out is: </p>
<p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph --></p>
<p><!-- wp:list --></p>
<ul>
<li>Channels: are 80% or more of the videos on the channel likely to be viewed by our ideal customers?</li>
<li>Videos: same criteria, but try to select whole channels if possible. Check to see if the video appears to still be getting a reasonable number of views (otherwise there won't be enough people to show ads to). </li>
</ul>
<p>
<!-- /wp:list --></p>
<p><!-- wp:paragraph --></p>
<p>I spent several hours researching the cryptocurrency landscape on YouTube, and built a placement list which I felt was well targeted. </p>
<p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph --></p>
<p><!-- wp:paragraph --></p>
<p>I also selected a 3 day site visitor audience for retargeting, and another one based off YouTube keywords which are very specific to the problem that this product solves within the crypto space (again, I wish I could be more specific here but I don't want to reveal anything commercially sensitive).</p>
<p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph --></p>
<p><!-- wp:paragraph --></p>
<p>Many of these channels are ones where the company has tried to get in video sponserships but the fees asked for by the influencers were deemed to be too high by the company. This way, we get the benefits of these influencers specific audiences, but without negotiations, wait time, and high sponsership fees.</p>
<p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph --></p>
<p><!-- wp:heading {"level":3} --></p>
<h3>Results</h3>
<p>
<!-- /wp:heading --></p>
<p><!-- wp:image {"id":4587,"sizeSlug":"large","linkDestination":"none"} --></p>
<figure class="wp-block-image size-large"><figure class="wp-image-4587"><img loading="lazy" src="https://duncanfelix.co.uk/media/posts/8/results-1-1024x439.png" sizes="100vw" srcset="https://duncanfelix.co.uk/media/posts/8/responsive/results-1-1024x439-xs.png 300w ,https://duncanfelix.co.uk/media/posts/8/responsive/results-1-1024x439-sm.png 480w ,https://duncanfelix.co.uk/media/posts/8/responsive/results-1-1024x439-md.png 768w ,https://duncanfelix.co.uk/media/posts/8/responsive/results-1-1024x439-lg.png 1024w ,https://duncanfelix.co.uk/media/posts/8/responsive/results-1-1024x439-xl.png 1360w ,https://duncanfelix.co.uk/media/posts/8/responsive/results-1-1024x439-2xl.png 1600w"  alt="" /></figure></figure>
<p>
<!-- /wp:image --></p>
<p><!-- wp:paragraph --></p>
<p>In the inital 7 day campaign (based around an event happening in the Crypto space), we were able to generate 118 direct sign ups, plus an additional 39 'view through conversions', which is people who didn't click 'sign up' in the YouTube ad but instead visited the website directly or through Google later and then signed up.</p>
<p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph --></p>
<p><!-- wp:paragraph --></p>
<p><strong>The cost per conversion was 30% lower</strong> than the benchmark for what the business was happy to pay to aquire a signup (based on their back end LTV calcs), for the campaigns that 'won' in testing. Including the testing budget, the cost per signup was in line with the benchmark. </p>
<p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph --></p>
<p><!-- wp:paragraph --></p>
<p><strong>The cost per sign up was 37% lower </strong>compared to Google Search Ads over the same time period.</p>
<p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph --></p>
<p><!-- wp:heading {"level":3} --></p>
<h3>Conclusion </h3>
<p>
<!-- /wp:heading --></p>
<p><!-- wp:paragraph --></p>
<p>After the initial 7 day campaign, the results are very encouraging. Typically YouTube ads take more experimentation and time to get good ROI, but in this case they worked well right out of the gate. </p>
<p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph --></p>
<p><!-- wp:paragraph --></p>
<p>The key here is that the product already has good product market fit, and has an offer which is suitable for paid traffic. I write more about this in my guide to YouTube ads for B2B. </p>

<p>Video editing is one of the most important aspects for any video project. The quality of the editor will determine how well your video looks and sounds, which in turn determines how successful it can be. But can you put a price on something so subjective? We've created this article to help give you an idea for what to expect at different prices.</p>
<p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph --></p>
<p><!-- wp:heading --></p>
<h2>How much does a video editor cost for YouTube? - Building a channel for your company</h2>
<p>
<!-- /wp:heading --></p>
<p><!-- wp:paragraph --></p>
<p>Building a B2B YouTube strategy for your brand can be a great way to get your products or services out there. YouTube is one of the most popular video sharing websites, which means it's an ideal place for new brands and companies to build their following. If you are interested in starting up a YouTube channel, how much will hired help cost? Well this depends on what kind of help you need.</p>
<p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph --></p>
<p><!-- wp:heading {"level":3} --></p>
<h3>How do you calculate video editing costs?</h3>
<p>
<!-- /wp:heading --></p>
<p><!-- wp:paragraph --></p>
<p>There's several variables which can change how much video editing costs, such as:</p>
<p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph --></p>
<p><!-- wp:list --></p>
<ul>
<li>Do you want to work with a freelance video editor or a company that provides post production services?</li>
<li>Type - There's several different types of videos you can choose from when making a video which will alter how long they take to create.</li>
<li>Is animation or motion graphics required?</li>
<li>How long does the video need to be?</li>
<li>Is it a single shot, or will multiple angles/shots be needed?</li>
<li>How much raw footage will they need to work with?</li>
<li>Do you want them to source music and stock footage for you, or do you already have some in mind?</li>
<li>Do you want them to create an intro, outro or logo for you? &nbsp;</li>
<li>How about subtitles in different languages?</li>
<li>How much creative input are you expecting from them - are you looking for them to help create a compelling story from source material, or go through a standard process to create the finished product?</li>
<li>How many rounds of changes do you anticipate? If there's lots of people in your company who need to 'sign off' on the video, budget for more editing time to get to the final product</li>
</ul>
<p>
<!-- /wp:list --></p>
<p><!-- wp:paragraph --></p>
<p>All this can sometimes seem a bit overwhelming, so let me break it down into simple steps...</p>
<p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph --></p>
<p><!-- wp:heading {"level":3} --></p>
<h3>Video Length</h3>
<p>
<!-- /wp:heading --></p>
<p><!-- wp:heading {"level":3} --></p>
<h3>How much does it cost to edit a 10 minute video?</h3>
<p>
<!-- /wp:heading --></p>
<p><!-- wp:paragraph --></p>
<p>If you want to make a simple video which will be uploaded and shared on the web, then you can hire someone for as little as $30 per hour. However at this level, expect to be working with a student or someone who is not a very experienced editor.</p>
<p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph --></p>
<p><!-- wp:paragraph --></p>
<p>If your project is more complicated than that - such as live streaming or high end effects like slow motion footage or animation - how much does it cost?</p>
<p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph --></p>
<p><!-- wp:paragraph --></p>
<p>Professional video editing rates are often in the $50-150 per hour range, or $400-800 per day on a daily rate.</p>
<p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph --></p>
<p><!-- wp:heading --></p>
<h2>Motion Graphics</h2>
<p>
<!-- /wp:heading --></p>
<p><!-- wp:paragraph --></p>
<p>How much does it cost to hire a motion graphics artist?</p>
<p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph --></p>
<p><!-- wp:paragraph --></p>
<p>Motion Graphics is an incredibly popular aspect of the video editing process, and one that many people are opting for in their projects. It can also be very expensive if you need lots of high end animation done.</p>
<p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph --></p>
<p><!-- wp:paragraph --></p>
<p>Some companies offer this as part of their standard video production service, but it can also be purchased separately.</p>
<p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph --></p>
<p><!-- wp:paragraph --></p>
<p>This is worth doing some research on if you are planning to include this in your project, because the costs can vary dramatically depending on how long and complex they need to be.</p>
<p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph --></p>
<p><!-- wp:heading --></p>
<h2>Animation or Motion Graphics?</h2>
<p>
<!-- /wp:heading --></p>
<p><!-- wp:heading {"level":3} --></p>
<h3>How much does animation cost per minute?</h3>
<p>
<!-- /wp:heading --></p>
<p><!-- wp:paragraph --></p>
<p>The costs associated with motion graphics animations vary depending on how complex they are and whether they're being created from scratch by a professional animator or using stock footage instead. If its high end / highly detailed products which will require multiple angles/shots in order to create them, then expect your budget needs looking at! :)&nbsp;</p>
<p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph --></p>
<p><!-- wp:paragraph --></p>
<p>If you're developing a video that will require lots of animations (such as an explainer video), then hiring professional animators could end up costing more than $100/minute - which quickly adds up when there's only 30 seconds of footage!</p>
<p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph --></p>
<p><!-- wp:paragraph --></p>
<p>A quick way to estimate what kind of budget needs looking at is based purely off length: If your finished product comes out longer than 60 seconds, I would recommend adding 'animation' to your list of things to look into.</p>

<h3>How much do you need to pay for a logo intro?</h3>
<p>
<!-- /wp:heading --></p>
<p><!-- wp:paragraph --></p>
<p>Logo intros are a great way to add an extra bit of impact and branding to your video, but they can also be expensive.</p>
<p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph --></p>
<p><!-- wp:paragraph --></p>
<p>Logos can be as simple as adding text and applying basic effects such as color correction - but if you want something more advanced like animation, it's going to cost you.</p>
<p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph --></p>
<p><!-- wp:paragraph --></p>
<p>If all you need is a simple logo reveal with an overlay, this can be done for as little as $20-30 per video - but expect the price to go up if there are lots of effects or color corrections needed too.</p>
<p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph --></p>
<p><!-- wp:heading {"level":3} --></p>
<h3>How much does stock footage cost?</h3>
<p>
<!-- /wp:heading --></p>
<p><!-- wp:paragraph --></p>
<p>Stock footage is often used for background shots or establishing scenes which will come before any dialogue starts taking place in the video. &nbsp;However if you're looking for specific types (such as nature or aerial), then this will become even more costly than hiring out professional editors! &nbsp;</p>
<p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph --></p>
<p><!-- wp:heading {"level":3} --></p>
<h3>Do I have any rights issues that might affect my video editing budget?</h3>
<p>
<!-- /wp:heading --></p>
<p><!-- wp:paragraph --></p>
<p>If there's music or other types of footage involved in the project, it may be worth getting legal advice before going ahead - especially if you want these elements included at no extra cost. This will prevent unnecessary surprises and costs further down the line. If they are not willing to make changes based on a suggestion from a third party, then this should also give you an indication about their ability as a creative professional.&nbsp;</p>
<p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph --></p>
<p><!-- wp:paragraph --></p>
<p>A good way to get around some potential pitfalls is through using royalty free stock footage or images instead of original content wherever possible - which won't cost the earth.</p>

<p><a href="https://www.leadshook.com/?aff=167" data-type="URL" data-id="https://www.leadshook.com/?aff=167">Leadshook</a> is a platform for creating interactive lead magnets. At least how that's I've used it. It's actually more versatile than that, and can be used across all parts of a business.</p>
<p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph --></p>
<p><!-- wp:paragraph --></p>
<p>The way I've used it is to create personalised and interactive tools to attract leads. For example, this <a rel="noreferrer noopener" href="https://uplevelgreen.com/solar-panel-calculator/" data-type="URL" data-id="https://uplevelgreen.com/solar-panel-calculator/" target="_blank">solar panel cost calculator</a>, which helps people in the UK decide if solar panels are worth it for them (only works for UK addresses right now). </p>
<p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph --></p>
<p><!-- wp:paragraph --></p>
<p>I've found it to be incredibly valuable, and the main reasons I've stuck with it over other tools are:</p>
<p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph --></p>
<p><!-- wp:list --></p>
<ul>
<li>It's incredibly flexible, you can build whatever you want </li>
<li>It's built by an experienced marketer so the functionality all makes sense for digital marketing (compared to 'survey' tools)</li>
<li>The community is probably the best out of any SaaS product, and the founder Nik is fantastic at taking time to help people get results with the software - better coaching than $2,000 digital marketing courses</li>
</ul>

<p><a href="https://lemlist.com" data-type="URL" data-id="https://lemlist.com">Lemlist</a> is one of those tools I orginally got in an AppSumo lifetime deal, and I'm really glad I did. They've seriously worked on it and improved since the orginal AppSumo deal. Personally I don't send very many cold emails so I'm not sure I would pay the monthly for this one. But the functionality is pretty great, especially the image personalisation features. I've briefly tried Snov.io and Lemlist seems a bit better than that, so I'm happy to reccomend it.</p>

<p>If you're going to be sending cold emails, you need some emails. <a href="https://findthatlead.com/pricing#_r_ulg256" data-type="URL" data-id="https://findthatlead.com/pricing#_r_ulg256" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">FindThatLead</a> is a one of those tools a bit like Hunter.io. To be honest, all the tools I've tested for this are bit hit and miss, but <a href="https://findthatlead.com/pricing#_r_ulg256" data-type="URL" data-id="https://findthatlead.com/pricing#_r_ulg256" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">FindThatLead</a> is as good as any, and it's the one I have the most experience with. Recently they added a feature similar to Builtwith, where you can search by specific technology (e.g Shopify) used on a website, then get contact info for the site owners. Buitwith charge a lot more for this feautre, so it does make <a href="https://findthatlead.com/pricing#_r_ulg256" data-type="URL" data-id="https://findthatlead.com/pricing#_r_ulg256" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">FindThatLead</a> seem better value.</p>

<p><a href="http://ahrefs.com/" data-type="URL" data-id="ahrefs.com/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Ahrefs</a> is hands down the best SEO tool I've tried. The smartest SaaS clients I've worked with have all used it internally. </p>

<p>I've tested a few different SEO writing tools, and Surfer is ahead of the pack, at least for now. I even have Outranking.io on a lifetime deal but ended up paying for Surfer on a monthly subscription because it's that much better. </p>

<p>Until people stop searching for things on the internet, blog content will have an important role in your business. That said, all internet users like to read blog posts.</p>
<p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph --></p>
<p><!-- wp:paragraph --></p>
<p>So if you have an existing content marketing strategy pretty much dialed in using written content plus social media images etc, and are looking to expand out and develop a video marketing and YouTube strategy, then having a way to turn blog posts, existing articles, infographics, and other written content into videos is a solid starting point.</p>
<p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph --></p>
<p><!-- wp:paragraph --></p>
<p>In this guide I'm going to show you some proven tips on how to turn a blog post into a video, using a process that many businesses are using to great success.</p>
<p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph --></p>
<p><!-- wp:paragraph --></p>
<p>I'll also dig into some of the software tools that can help you create videos, grow your YouTube channel and do fantastic video marketing!</p>
<p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph --></p>
<p><!-- wp:heading --></p>
<h2>How to Select Which Blog Posts to use to Create Videos for Your YouTube Channel</h2>
<p>
<!-- /wp:heading --></p>
<p><!-- wp:paragraph --></p>
<p>You want a great article to start with when you're looking to turn blog posts into videos. It can be an old article that gets good web traffic, or a new blog post.</p>
<p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph --></p>
<p><!-- wp:paragraph --></p>
<p>What we're doing here is finding what content that already strongly resonates with people.</p>
<p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph --></p>
<p><!-- wp:paragraph --></p>
<p>Instead of doing lots of work to research new topic ideas, stand on the shoulders of giants by improving what's already working well, to bring even more traffic into your small business or SaaS product.</p>
<p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph --></p>
<p><!-- wp:heading {"level":3} --></p>
<h3>Identifying Popular Content</h3>
<p>
<!-- /wp:heading --></p>
<p><!-- wp:paragraph --></p>
<p>We want to ensure that the content is consistently popular, and not just because it got lucky with a particular week on social media for example. So the approach I reccomend is 'SEO first'.</p>
<p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph --></p>
<p><!-- wp:heading {"level":4} --></p>
<h4>Using Ahrefs Site Explorer</h4>
<p>
<!-- /wp:heading --></p>
<p><!-- wp:paragraph --></p>
<p>Log into Ahrefs and go to site explorer, then type your domain in, and select 'top pages' on the right hand nav.</p>
<p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph --></p>
<p><!-- wp:image --></p>

<p>
<!-- /wp:image --></p>
<p><!-- wp:paragraph --></p>
<p>You should be able to see a list of top pages on your site. Export this as an excel file and then open that in your favourite spreadsheet editor (I'm using Google Sheets).</p>
<p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph --></p>
<p><!-- wp:paragraph --></p>
<p>Next, you want to ignore pages like ad campaign landing pages, features, pricing, home page, about, etc. and focus on articles and blogs. You can even just delete those rows from your spreadsheet.</p>
<p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph --></p>
<p><!-- wp:paragraph --></p>
<p>Make a note of content that has the most traffic, and also the 'top keyword' which will give you an idea of the intent behind a good amount of people who are finding your content from search engines.</p>
<p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph --></p>
<p><!-- wp:paragraph --></p>
<p>Now, many of the entries on this should be great options to turn blog posts into videos.</p>
<p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph --></p>
<p><!-- wp:heading --></p>
<h2>Process for Creating Videos from Blog Posts</h2>
<p>
<!-- /wp:heading --></p>
<p><!-- wp:paragraph --></p>
<p>The actual video production process looks like this:</p>
<p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph --></p>
<p><!-- wp:list {"ordered":true} --></p>
<ol>
<li>Re-write the article into a video script</li>
<li>Film a presenter reading the script</li>
<li>Edit the presenter video</li>
<li>Add stock video &amp; basic graphics (titles, screenshots, illustrations)</li>
<li>Refine the graphics (animate the illustrations etc)</li>
<li>(Optional) Check the video internally</li>
<li>Create optimised thumbnail, titles, tags and description for YouTube</li>
<li>Publish to YouTube or schedule for your regular slot (1-3 times a month works well)</li>
<li>Promote by adding to the orginal blogpost, sharing on social media and adding to email flows etc.</li>
</ol>
<p>
<!-- /wp:list --></p>
<p><!-- wp:heading {"level":3} --></p>
<h3>How to re-write an article as a video script for YouTube</h3>
<p>
<!-- /wp:heading --></p>
<p><!-- wp:paragraph --></p>
<p>The main things you want to aim for when turning a blog post into a video are: making it more conversational,and picking up the pace a little bit. Unfortuantly you can't just 100% copy and paste text.</p>
<p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph --></p>
<p><!-- wp:paragraph --></p>
<p>Videos typically work best when they're around 50-80% of the word count of the original article.</p>
<p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph --></p>
<p><!-- wp:paragraph --></p>
<p>It's easier for people to skim text in articles, but for people who prefer video - they can't do that as easily, so it helps to pick up the pace a bit.</p>
<p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph --></p>
<p><!-- wp:paragraph --></p>
<p>If it's a really long article, then you can split that into multiple videos.</p>
<p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph --></p>
<p><!-- wp:paragraph --></p>
<p>For example: A 13,000 word epic skyscraper blogpost would take around 20-30 minutes for people to watch in full on YouTube depending on how good your video editor skills are!</p>
<p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph --></p>
<p><!-- wp:paragraph --></p>
<p>To make your blog post more conversational, think about what people would say if they were talking to you explaining the story.</p>
<p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph --></p>
<p><!-- wp:paragraph --></p>
<p>How does that sound? Can you speak it out loud, record yourself and then play back? Does that feel more conversational or natural than your original article did?</p>
<p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph --></p>
<p><!-- wp:paragraph --></p>
<p>Is there another way to get across your main points whilst sounding a bit more like you're explaining them to a friend?</p>
<p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph --></p>
<p><!-- wp:paragraph --></p>
<p>This is an iterative process - looking at draft videos on a phone can be helpful for this.</p>
<p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph --></p>
<p><!-- wp:heading {"level":3} --></p>
<h3>Film a presenter reading the script</h3>
<p>
<!-- /wp:heading --></p>
<p><!-- wp:paragraph --></p>
<p>To film a presenter reading the script, at the most basic level, all you need is a laptop and a desk.</p>
<p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph --></p>
<p><!-- wp:paragraph --></p>
<p>If you've got an iMac or MacBook Pro with any kind of editing software on it then that's great! Just set up your camera in front of you and hit record.</p>
<p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph --></p>
<p><!-- wp:paragraph --></p>
<p>Of course, if you want more polished videos that help your company come across as friendly but still professional, then it's better to invest in a professional setup.</p>
<p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph --></p>
<p><!-- wp:paragraph --></p>
<p>You can either hire a presenter online who has an existing recording set up, or you can bring that role in house, either as a full time YouTube presenter role, or if you're the co founder yourself then being the face of your own business (think Noah Kagan of AppSumo, or Richard Branson) also works well.</p>
<p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph --></p>
<p><!-- wp:paragraph --></p>
<p>The presenter video content also provides the voice overs for parts of your YouTube video that have photos, slides, motion graphics, or stock footage on screen.</p>
<p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph --></p>
<p><!-- wp:heading {"level":3} --></p>
<h3>The ideal filming setup for YouTube is :</h3>
<p>
<!-- /wp:heading --></p>
<p><!-- wp:paragraph --></p>
<p>A DSLR camera (Canon and Nikon are the most common brands) with a 'fast' lens. Don't worry about this too much, but it's basically how well the camera performs in low light conditions - lenses like f/1.8 or f/2.8 let more light into your images.</p>
<p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph --></p>
<p><!-- wp:paragraph --></p>
<p>Visually, it also helps blur the background and make the presenter 'pop' out from it.</p>
<p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph --></p>
<p><!-- wp:paragraph --></p>
<p>A tripod. Again, any one you've got in your house will work for this - but if you want to invest in a good quality video camera setup then it's worth also investing in tripods that are sturdy and reliable. It's a tool that will last basically forever if you invest in a high quality one.</p>
<p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph --></p>
<p><!-- wp:paragraph --></p>
<p>Wireless lav microphones (the small mic clips on the shirt). This means that your presenter can wander around the room, or at least face different directions without the audio getting quieter when they turn away.</p>
<p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph --></p>
<p><!-- wp:paragraph --></p>
<p>Another great option is to simply have a condenser microphone on a stand on the desk, like you will have seen if you've ever tuned in for an episode of the Joe Rogan Experience.</p>
<p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph --></p>
<p><!-- wp:paragraph --></p>
<p>Background: you have a few options here:</p>
<p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph --></p>
<p><!-- wp:paragraph --></p>
<p>A green screen is tempting but actually quite hard to pull off without looking tacky. If you must go for a green screen, you really need to have a good amount of space, and invest heavily into good lighting.</p>
<p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph --></p>
<p><!-- wp:paragraph --></p>
<p>This is because you need good seperation between the different light sources to ensure you don't have 'spill' - green colour going across your presenter's face.</p>
<p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph --></p>
<p><!-- wp:paragraph --></p>
<p>Whiteboards - great if you want to run through the key points of your topic on screen with a presenter at the same time! But it can also end up looking tacky as they have been used a lot in 'internet marketer' style videos.</p>
<p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph --></p>
<p><!-- wp:paragraph --></p>
<p>What I would reccomend however is a simple plain coloured background - ideally something dark like grey or black to make your presenter pop out, avoiding distracting backgrounds.</p>
<p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph --></p>
<p><!-- wp:paragraph --></p>
<p>Pro tip: a classic lighting technique is to add a highlight just behind the presenter, as well as a side light to help them pop out even more cleanly.</p>
<p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph --></p>
<p><!-- wp:paragraph --></p>
<p>You can buy a paper roll in most stationary shops (e.g: Paperchase) which is great for this - just unroll it on the background area, double side tape down along one edge onto the wall/floor etc. Again, the key here is good lighting, which I will cover in more detail in just a second.</p>
<p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph --></p>
<p><!-- wp:paragraph --></p>
<p>Another great option is to create a casual office or home space which has a variety of foreground and background items to create a sense of depth.</p>
<p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph --></p>
<p><!-- wp:paragraph --></p>
<p>This is where having a 'fast' lens comes in handy, as it can look really nice to blur the background in these types of setups.</p>
<p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph --></p>
<p><!-- wp:paragraph --></p>
<p>One note that I've picked up from watching movies, is to always have a selection of lamps in the frame at different distances from the camera - it really adds to that sense of depth.</p>
<p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph --></p>
<p><!-- wp:heading {"level":3} --></p>
<h3>Editing the presenter video</h3>
<p>
<!-- /wp:heading --></p>
<p><!-- wp:paragraph --></p>
<p>The next step is to take the recording from the presenter, whether that's something you've filmed yourself, or have hired a freelance presenter to record themselves, and edit it into the base of your video.</p>
<p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph --></p>
<p><!-- wp:paragraph --></p>
<p>This is where you're creating the structure of your video. Edit out any unnatural pauses or parts of the text which just don't across as well when you hear them being spoken (as opposed to just reading on a screen).</p>
<p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph --></p>
<p><!-- wp:paragraph --></p>
<p><strong>Optional: Add music</strong></p>
<p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph --></p>
<p><!-- wp:paragraph --></p>
<p>Whether or not you want to add music to your video file is matter of opinion. A lot of good videos don't have music, and you certainly don't need it to do a great job with your YouTube videos. But sometimes it can help add personality and a powerful tool to enhance emotions. In other words - it's your call.</p>
<p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph --></p>
<p><!-- wp:paragraph --></p>
<p>Once this is done, you're ready to move on to adding graphics to the video.</p>
<p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph --></p>
<p><!-- wp:heading {"level":3} --></p>
<h3>Add stock video &amp; basic graphics</h3>
<p>
<!-- /wp:heading --></p>
<p><!-- wp:paragraph --></p>
<p>Now you'll want to make the video more visually interesting than just a talking head, by adding relevant stock footage as well as graphics such as titles, screenshots, and illustrations .</p>
<p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph --></p>
<p><!-- wp:paragraph --></p>
<p>A key tip here is to choose stock video which actually enhances the message you are trying to send, rather than just being pretty filler. For example, if you're talking about how fast a car can go - do not use slow motion footage of someone running. Do instead use high speed camera technology that gives people an idea for what 'fast' really means.</p>
<p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph --></p>
<p><!-- wp:paragraph --></p>
<p>Motion graphics titles help to break up the video and establish what you're talking about at each point. You can also use them to add a bit of personality, so if your business has a mascot character or something similar - put it in there somewhere!</p>
<p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph --></p>
<p><!-- wp:paragraph --></p>
<p>If you're using a lot of graphics and illustrations, it can be helpful to give them all the same look and feel - maybe choose a colour palette that matches your company branding so they really fit in.</p>
<p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph --></p>
<p><!-- wp:paragraph --></p>
<p>This is where most people get stuck when turning their blog posts into videos - but don't worry! It's actually quite straightforward if you do things in stages.</p>
<p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph --></p>
<p><!-- wp:paragraph --></p>
<p>Don't try to do a lot of fancy animation at first, just get the main building blocks in place by dropping in still illustrations (in vector format so they can be animated later).</p>
<p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph --></p>
<p><!-- wp:paragraph --></p>
<p>Adobe After Effects is my favourite software tool to use here, but I hate to say it: you can even use Microsoft Powerpoint if that's what you already know.</p>
<p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph --></p>
<p><!-- wp:paragraph --></p>
<p>Remember that you can easily get good quality vector illustrations from sites like Envato or Creative Market.</p>
<p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph --></p>
<p><!-- wp:heading {"level":3} --></p>
<h3>Refine the graphics</h3>
<p>
<!-- /wp:heading --></p>
<p><!-- wp:paragraph --></p>
<p>Once you're happy with the overal structure and flow, and you have an almost finished video, it's time to add a bit of polish to your motion graphics.</p>
<p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph --></p>
<p><!-- wp:paragraph --></p>
<p>This is where the fun happens! Explore different ways of animating your illustrations, to really bring them to life. You can also experiment with adding in extra details or embellishments that you couldn't fit into the video's structure before. For example, if there was a section about how much money something costs - you could have some numbers flip round on screen until they hit the correct figure.</p>
<p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph --></p>
<p><!-- wp:heading {"level":3} --></p>
<h3>Check the video internally</h3>
<p>
<!-- /wp:heading --></p>
<p><!-- wp:paragraph --></p>
<p>If you're working with a video production consultant to get these videos done (like me), then typically you'll get a chance to preview the video before it's published, and make any last minute tweaks to ensure it's on brand.</p>
<p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph --></p>
<p><!-- wp:paragraph --></p>
<p>Or if you're doing this in your in house marketing team, you can use a tool like Wipster to share videos with team members and get feedback before they go live.</p>
<p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph --></p>
<p><!-- wp:paragraph --></p>
<p>If all has gone well, your video should be ready!</p>
<p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph --></p>
<p><!-- wp:heading {"level":3} --></p>
<h3>Create an optmised thumbnail, title, description, and tags for YouTube</h3>
<p>
<!-- /wp:heading --></p>
<p><!-- wp:paragraph --></p>
<p>The last step is to create a video which you can actually share online. This means uploading the file to YouTube, and then customising how it's presented - including adding an attention grabbing thumbnail image, as well as a title, description and tags that will encourage people to watch (and hopefully share!) your awesome video.</p>
<p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph --></p>
<p><!-- wp:paragraph --></p>
<p>It's a fine line between accurate and on brand, and clickbaity (because you want people to actually watch!). Remember that YouTube takes into account both clickthrough rate and watch time in their algorithm, so you want to aim for a title that's accurate but also enticing.</p>
<p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph --></p>
<p><!-- wp:paragraph --></p>
<p>This is where having someone knowledgeable in your team (or outside help) will really pay off - because the best layout for your thumbnail image, plus a great description and keywords are essential at this stage, as they influence how likely people are to find it when searching online. And don't forget about tags! Tags are a great way to describe your video within YouTube's system, and also help with discoverability.</p>
<p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph --></p>
<p><!-- wp:paragraph --></p>
<p>Remember that everything you do online is public - so if you're going to put the effort into producing these videos for marketing purposes, make sure they'll reach as many people as possible!</p>
<p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph --></p>
<p><!-- wp:heading {"level":3} --></p>
<h3>Upload to YouTube or schedule for your regular slot</h3>
<p>
<!-- /wp:heading --></p>
<p><!-- wp:paragraph --></p>
<p>Once you're happy with the video, it's just a case of uploading to YouTube - or scheduling for your regular slot (1-3 times per month often works well).</p>
<p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph --></p>
<p><!-- wp:paragraph --></p>
<p>And voila! Your amazing blog post has turned into an awesome video that can be shared by your audience!</p>
<p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph --></p>
<p><!-- wp:paragraph --></p>
<p>So what are you waiting for? Click publish and (optional) do a little dance of celebration.</p>
<p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph --></p>
<p><!-- wp:heading {"level":3} --></p>
<h3>Promote by adding to the orginal blogpost, sharing on social media and adding to email flows</h3>
<p>
<!-- /wp:heading --></p>
<p><!-- wp:paragraph --></p>
<p>The usual rules apply when you're turning blog posts into videos...</p>
<p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph --></p>
<p><!-- wp:paragraph --></p>
<p>Don't just hit publish and hope for the best!</p>
<p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph --></p>
<p><!-- wp:paragraph --></p>
<p>The final step is to promote your videos by adding links and embeds in the original blog post, sending out in your marketing emails, as well as sharing to Facebook, and your other social channels. Remember to also link to the original post page on your website for non video users.</p>
<p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph --></p>
<p><!-- wp:paragraph --></p>
<p>Try to favour promoting it just to the most relevant audiences that you have on your email list and social media channels, as this will give your video the highest possible watch time percentage, leading to the best long term results.</p>
<p>

                    <img src="https://duncanfelix.co.uk/media/posts/16/close-up-african-american-girl-dreamily-posing-on-2021-08-27-09-43-10-utc.jpg" alt="" />
                <p><!-- wp:paragraph --></p>
<p>YouTube ads are a great way to reach your target audience, even if they're not actively searching for your products or services. This blog post will give you the lowdown on YouTube advertising and how it can be used as an effective marketing tool in B2B settings, based on my experience using them to <a href="https://photonicgrowth.com/case-study/how-to-generate-leads-for-solar-sales-solar-lead-generation-case-study/" data-type="page" data-id="4572">generate leads for solar sales</a>, and increase user signups for SaaS products.</p>
<p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph --></p>
<p><!-- wp:paragraph --></p>
<p>YouTube is one of the most popular video-sharing sites on the internet with 1 billion active users every single day. It's also the second largest search engine.</p>
<p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph --></p>
<p><!-- wp:paragraph --></p>
<p>It's no wonder that marketers have been using this powerful platform to advertise their brands since 2007, when the Google Ads team first introduced them to advertisers looking for a new outlet.</p>
<p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph --></p>
<p><!-- wp:paragraph --></p>
<p>These days, it's easy to create a YouTube ad from scratch or promote your videos from within other social media channels like Facebook and Twitter--the opportunities are endless!</p>
<p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph --></p>
<p><!-- wp:paragraph --></p>
<p>It used to be that people in B2B marketing had very limited options for reaching niche audiences on YouTube.</p>
<p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph --></p>
<p><!-- wp:paragraph --></p>
<p>It was fine if you had TVs or energy drinks to sell, but if you needed to target a more specific business audience, you were out of luck and forced to target audiences like “business travellers” (whatever that means).</p>
<p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph --></p>
<p><!-- wp:paragraph --></p>
<p>Now though, you’re able to be a million times more specfic in which audiences you can select to show ads to, which has opened up massive opportunites for B2B SaaS companies that already have good product market fit.</p>
<p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph --></p>
<p><!-- wp:paragraph --></p>
<p>Video marketing using YouTube ads is like having the entire world of potential customers all turning up at your booth in a giant trade show - good news for B2B marketers!</p>
<p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph --></p>
<p><!-- wp:block {"ref":4284} /--></p>
<p><!-- wp:heading --></p>
<h2><strong>The Opportunity</strong></h2>
<p>
<!-- /wp:heading --></p>
<p><!-- wp:heading --></p>
<h2><strong>YouTube for B2B: Overall Marketing Strategy</strong></h2>
<p>
<!-- /wp:heading --></p>
<p><!-- wp:paragraph --></p>
<p>Rule number one of digital marketing is that first, you must have the right offer that works with paid traffic.</p>
<p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph --></p>
<p><!-- wp:paragraph --></p>
<p>I can’t emphasise this enough. If you do not have an offer that fits with how paid traffic works, then you will burn cash and waste your time. There’s no amount of fancy AI targeting that will <em>force</em> an offer to work.</p>
<p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph --></p>
<p><!-- wp:paragraph --></p>
<p>So how do you ensure you have a good offer?</p>
<p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph --></p>
<p><!-- wp:paragraph --></p>
<p>First you need to understand that there are different groups of people availabe to you on YouTube (or any other ad platform). Typically, these audiences are:</p>
<p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph --></p>
<p><!-- wp:list --></p>
<ul>
<li>The small but highly invested audience</li>
<li>The wider but less invested audience</li>
<li>Everyone else on YouTube</li>
<li>understanding the principles of thwe audiences on paid traffic</li>
<li>the angle of your offer</li>
<li>who it can be sold to</li>
<li>pricing</li>
<li>first undertand who you’re talking to – if you try to talk to everyone else the way you’d talk to the highly invested audience, it will not work.</li>
</ul>
<p>
<!-- /wp:list --></p>
<p><!-- wp:heading {"level":4} --></p>
<h4>Types of Ads on YouTube</h4>
<p>
<!-- /wp:heading --></p>
<p><!-- wp:paragraph --></p>
<p>Instream ads are the standard skipable ads which you see when you’re <em>trying</em> to watch another video. These are the simplest ones and therefore the best to start with. Find the simplest thing possible which works, and then only make it more complex if absolutely necessary.</p>
<p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph --></p>
<p><!-- wp:heading --></p>
<h2><strong>Examples</strong> of B2B YouTube Ads</h2>
<p>
<!-- /wp:heading --></p>
<p><!-- wp:heading {"level":3} --></p>
<h3><strong>How to Find Examples</strong></h3>
<p>
<!-- /wp:heading --></p>
<p><!-- wp:heading --></p>
<h2><strong>Scriptwriting</strong></h2>
<p>
<!-- /wp:heading --></p>
<p><!-- wp:list --></p>
<ul>
<li>Having a good script means a much lower cost per click, which means an overal much lower cost to aquire a new user.</li>
<li>Most important thing: knowing what your customer <em>really </em>wants. Not what you think they want.</li>
<li>People essentially want effortless quick results</li>
<li>Make sure to create many scripts in order to figure out which one works best.</li>
</ul>
<p>
<!-- /wp:list --></p>
<p><!-- wp:heading {"level":4} --></p>
<h4>Script opener: Hook Viewers Quickly</h4>
<p>
<!-- /wp:heading --></p>
<p><!-- wp:paragraph --></p>
<p>You need to call out the intended audience quickly, and get them to keep watching. A lot of people think they just need to do something really attention grabbing for everyone, but you actually want to focus on the specific audience who might want to try your product. This is especially the case in B2B.</p>
<p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph --></p>
<p><!-- wp:paragraph --></p>
<p>It used to be true that YouTube would only charge you for people who watched past 30 seconds, and so you will probably read other advice that tells you to actively tell non ideal customers to <em>stop watching </em>and click skip. That has since changed, and in most cases you will pay per 1,000 ‘impressions’ instead. But it’s still important to capture the attention of the right people early on your video.</p>
<p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph --></p>
<p><!-- wp:heading {"level":3} --></p>
<h3>"Kick the bruised knee" to Build Emotional Tension</h3>
<p>
<!-- /wp:heading --></p>
<p><!-- wp:paragraph --></p>
<p>The emotional tension here means that people will be more likely to watch what happens next.</p>
<p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph --></p>
<p><!-- wp:paragraph --></p>
<p>It’s an opening scene from a TV show, and even if you can't explain it in words, the audience knows exactly what is going on - do they help this person or not?</p>
<p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph --></p>
<p><!-- wp:heading {"level":3} --></p>
<h3>Build Relationships by Showing them You Understand their Pain</h3>
<p>
<!-- /wp:heading --></p>
<p><!-- wp:paragraph --></p>
<p>The second they feel like you understand them, they will be much more likely to watch your video.</p>
<p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph --></p>
<p><!-- wp:paragraph --></p>
<p>Show that You Understand their Pain Better than Competitors</p>
<p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph --></p>
<p><!-- wp:paragraph --></p>
<p>People are always willing to hear about how something works when it’s relevant and if they think there is an easy way out of their problems.</p>
<p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph --></p>
<p><!-- wp:heading {"level":3} --></p>
<h3>Show that You Can Help Solve their Problem</h3>
<p>
<!-- /wp:heading --></p>
<p><!-- wp:paragraph --></p>
<p>You need to show them why you are the best solution.</p>
<p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph --></p>
<p><!-- wp:paragraph --></p>
<p>So if they feel like another company might be able to help, but only after a long drawn out process, then it’s not relevant for them right now and they will most likely ignore it.</p>
<p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph --></p>
<p><!-- wp:paragraph --></p>
<p>Be Authentic in order to Build Trust.</p>
<p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph --></p>
<p><!-- wp:paragraph --></p>
<p>People buy based on trust. Don't make unrealistic promises here, B2B buyers might still be influenced by emotion, but they're also savvy and will see through an over promising.</p>
<p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph --></p>
<p><!-- wp:heading {"level":3} --></p>
<h3>Call to Action</h3>
<p>
<!-- /wp:heading --></p>
<p><!-- wp:paragraph --></p>
<p>Most people will skip your video if you don’t tell them to watch the end. Make sure that you ask for something at this point, such filling out a form, taking a free assesment, booking a call on your calendar, or signing up for a free trial.</p>
<p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph --></p>
<p><!-- wp:paragraph --></p>
<p>Show this next step on screen.</p>
<p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph --></p>
<p><!-- wp:paragraph --></p>
<p>Make it so obvious that a five year old could not miss it.</p>
<p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph --></p>
<p><!-- wp:paragraph --></p>
<p>It's not patronising, it's simply an effective digital marketing strategy, just as skilled pilots have incredibly simple prompts and checklists for times when they are least likely to be paying a lot of attention to something important.</p>
<p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph --></p>
<p><!-- wp:heading --></p>
<h2><strong>Video production</strong></h2>
<p>
<!-- /wp:heading --></p>
<p><!-- wp:heading {"level":3} --></p>
<h3><strong>Finding a presenter</strong></h3>
<p>
<!-- /wp:heading --></p>
<p><!-- wp:paragraph --></p>
<p>Finding a presenter for your YouTube ads is important, because this is where viewers will feel the most trust in your product.</p>
<p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph --></p>
<p><!-- wp:paragraph --></p>
<p>Explainer videos using animation are great, but I've found that seeing actual human beings in your skippable ads is a great way to hook viewers quickly and really connect with potential customers.</p>
<p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph --></p>
<p><!-- wp:paragraph --></p>
<p>If you’re not good at public speaking yourself (for example as the co founder of the product) but still want to do a video ad campaign I would suggest looking for someone who can speak on behalf of your company who has a lot of experience being on camera.</p>
<p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph --></p>
<p><!-- wp:heading {"level":3} --></p>
<h3><strong>Finding an Editor</strong></h3>
<p>
<!-- /wp:heading --></p>
<p><!-- wp:paragraph --></p>
<p>This is a tough one, but it’s important.</p>
<p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph --></p>
<p><!-- wp:paragraph --></p>
<p>Find someone who really understands how YouTube ads for B2B work and knows what they are doing with video production - don't just hire anyone!</p>
<p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph --></p>
<p><!-- wp:paragraph --></p>
<p>It needs to be done well in order to get results, so make sure you have this covered before trying to launch your ad campaign.</p>
<p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph --></p>
<p><!-- wp:heading {"level":3} --></p>
<h3>Recommended Stock Footage Sites (For All Budgets)</h3>
<p>
<!-- /wp:heading --></p>
<p><!-- wp:heading {"level":4} --></p>
<h4>Low Budget</h4>
<p>
<!-- /wp:heading --></p>

<p>The quality is generally very good, although the search features aren’t very refined so you will spend longer searching than on Filmsupply.</p>

<h4>Medium Budget</h4>
<p>
<!-- /wp:heading --></p>
<p><!-- wp:paragraph --></p>
<p><strong>Shutterstock</strong> – Pay per clip, starting at around $30 but varies depending on the clip and your usage.</p>
<p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph --></p>
<p><!-- wp:paragraph --></p>
<p>They have the largest range of footage available out of these three, and possibly the largest range available anywhere. So chances are if you’re looking for something quite specific, then they will have it. To give you an example I recently produced some videos for an large health insurer. They wanted to see an older person having a physiotherapy session at home. Pretty specific! And I was able to easily find this on Shutterstock.</p>

<h4>Big Budget</h4>
<p>
<!-- /wp:heading --></p>
<p><!-- wp:paragraph --></p>
<p><strong>Filmsupply</strong> – Starting at a few hundred dollars per video.</p>
<p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph --></p>
<p><!-- wp:paragraph --></p>
<p>Filmsupply is the most expensive option but also by far the highest quality. They have tons of cinematic content available to license.</p>

<h2><strong>Targeting</strong></h2>
<p>
<!-- /wp:heading --></p>
<p><!-- wp:paragraph --></p>
<p>Targeting the right audience is absolutely critical to the success of your video ad, and it’s something that a lot of people neglect.</p>
<p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph --></p>
<p><!-- wp:paragraph --></p>
<p>Identify who you think would be interested in your product or service. You could get this information from social media, Google analytics about where they originally came from, etc.</p>
<p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph --></p>
<p><!-- wp:paragraph --></p>
<p>What I've found works best however for companies new to YouTube ads for B2B, is to use Placement Targeting. This is where you allow YouTube to show ads on specific videos and other channels that people are watching related to your product.</p>
<p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph --></p>
<p><!-- wp:paragraph --></p>
<p>This is a bit of time consuming process, but totally worth it if you seriously want to generate leads and sales for your business.</p>
<p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph --></p>
<p><!-- wp:paragraph --></p>
<p>Another option that can work well if you already have a branded YouTube channel is to retarget viewers, as you've already started to build relationships with them. If you don't have an existing YouTube channel with a decent amount of recent watch time, then you can also try retargeting visitors to your company website.</p>

<h2>Next Steps</h2>
<p>
<!-- /wp:heading --></p>
<p><!-- wp:paragraph --></p>
<p>As you can see there is a lot that goes into launching an effective YouTube ad campaign, but it's worth it if done well.</p>
<p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph --></p>
<p><!-- wp:paragraph --></p>
<p>Depending on your budget and the size of your business I would suggest starting with placement targeting as this will help to filter out people who won't be interested in what you have to offer right away - saving both time and money.</p>
<p>

<p><!-- wp:paragraph --></p>
<p>Create a 3-4 variations of your video script, get it filmed and edited and then you're away!</p>
