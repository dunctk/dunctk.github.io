At the time, their previous provider was unable to provide the content that had been uploaded over the years in an accessible and transferable format.</p><p></p><p></p><p>So what they were left to do was look at bringing in a number of temporary staff to manually download and copy content into a format suitable for the new platform. It was even unclear whether it would be possible to download content in this way, as there were a number of mechanisms designed to stop this (even though they had the rights to their own content).</p><p></p><p></p><p>What I was able to do was create a script using Python and a web scraping library called <a href="https://www.selenium.dev/" data-type="URL" data-id="https://www.selenium.dev/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Selenium</a>, which systematically crawled the legacy system, and stored the content in a database.</p><p></p><p></p><p>I then added to this another script which connected with the API of the new platform, and with some checks in between, uploaded the content to the appropriate locations on this new LMS system.</p><p></p><p></p><h3 class="gb-headline gb-headline-766a1b41 gb-headline-text">Content Creation</h3><p></p><p></p><p>My background is in content creation in multiple forms.
